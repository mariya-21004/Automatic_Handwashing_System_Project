# Automatic_Handwashing_System_Project
This repository contains the complete project files for an automatic, contact less hand washing system developed using Arduino. The system automatically dispenses soap and water and activates a hand dryer without the need for physical contact, aiming to improve hygiene and reduce infection risks.Project Report: Detailed documentation of the problem statement, design approach, hardware components, block diagram, flowcharts, and system operation. Source Code: Arduino sketch files implementing sensor detection and relay control logic.
